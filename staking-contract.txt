-----staking contract-----

deployment arguments

- X contract address of NFT collection to be stakable (whitelist)
- X how many tokens are emitted per block as rewards


staking (deposit NFT)

- X stake 1 NFT the user owns
- X stake all approved NFTs the user has
- X contract should take control of the NFT and log the block to keep track of rewards


un-staking (withdraw NFT)

- X unstake 1 NFT
- X unstake all NFTs
- X unstaking should also claim all pending rewards for that user once the NFT(s) are successfully transfered


claim rewards

- claim all ERC20 rewards for user while leaving NFTs to accumulate more rewards


call methods

- X erc20 balance of the contract
- X reward token per block
- X total NFTs staked by all users
- ! how many NFTs the user has staked
- ! Which NFTs the user has staked by ID (array usable by front end to withdraw/claim reward) 
   ! NOTE: (DO NOT Advise due to extremely high gas costs and unnecessary. I recommend storing these values in an off-chain database.)


security

- X one block must pass before user can claim reward
- X rewards should be (number of blocks since stake - current block) to avoid exploit
