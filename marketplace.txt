MARKETPLACE - Market.sol

The NFTs in this marketplace are only going to be from the contract I made.
Price will be in ERC20 rather than Ether
Create feature to allow new NFT contract to work with this marketplace.
Can ONLY pay with the ERC20 token from the staking contract!
Use Dummy ERC20 Token with 9 Decimals.
Use Staking contract with the Array.

Deployment
- admin/owner set to deployer
- set fee collector (address to send fees to)
- set fee in percent (5% for example) (Ex. 5% of the sale will go to the dev)
- Create function to change the fee dev address in the future only by the owner.
- set ERC20 token (9 decimals)

Updatable
- whitelisted NFT addresses (allow many) (entire array so they can be removed)
- collector
- admin/owner
- fee in percent (update the fee amount)
- ERC20 token

Marketplace
- allow user to list NFT by contract address and token ID for amount in ERC20 (putting NFT up for sale)
- safeTransferFrom NFT to/from Market contract (amount = 1, data = empty array) (putting NFT up for sale)
