NFTs
- Return token IDs for owner ERC1155
- Should get balance of IDs for any contract that you give it.
- Get all NFTs a user owns

**Create ReplicaSet to be able to listen to DB changes

Deploy => POST => Mint

Justin will use Remix to deployed NFT smart contract,
then he will do a POST to update the DB with the new contract address.
The backend will listen for the change event to then create new listeners
with the new contract address,
along with all the old ones.


MARKETPLACE
- Display all for sale
- Display sold (time stamp or recent to help sort by recent if possible)
  - Use event filtering because this will cost a lot in the DB & redundant.
- All whitelisted NFT contracts
  - Remove from SC and use DB instead

PERSONAL PAGE
- Display for sale by owner
- Display recently sold by owner (Not needed in DB)

All returns should have sortable data like:
Collection
Owner
Price
