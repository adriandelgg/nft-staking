Marketplace Contract:
- The marketplace contract address must be given
  to "contract.ts" in the "helpers" folder.

Authorization/Authentication:
- Once you have signed in, from the front end you want to save the returned JWT token
  that's given to you via the HTTP headers in a cookie.
  With this cookie, whenever you make a request you want to attach it to the
  "x-auth-token" header so that the backend can do its job.
